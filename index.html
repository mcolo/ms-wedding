Everyone is more than welcome to join us on Friday and stay until Sunday, but arriving on Saturday is of course also an option. Below is the preliminary itinerary:</p><p class="description">Friday: After everyone has settled into their rooms, we will be hosting a casual dinner outdoors. The time for this event is yet to be determined, since the boat schedules will be taken into consideration.</p><p class="description">Saturday: Breakfast will be served at the inn, and the day is then at your disposal. Go for a swim, sunbathe, go kayaking, explore the island or relax in the hammocks by the restaurant. For lunch, we recommend heading to either the restaurant or the café by the guest harbor. The ceremony will be starting at 4pm, and will be immediately followed by a cocktail hour and a reception dinner. Do you want to do us the honor of giving a speech or a toast during the dinner? Please let us know at <a href="mailto:miracolowedding@gmail.com">miracolowedding@gmail.com</a>.</p><p class="description">Sunday: After we have enjoyed breakfast together, it will be time to leave Lidö.</p><p class="description">Dress code: This is a summer wedding in Sweden – suits will thus be comfortable to wear, and a dress could preferably be accompanied by a scarf or cardigan come evening time.</p><p class="description">Babies and small children are of course more than welcome.</p><p class="description">Don't forget to bring: warm sweater, bathing suit, SPF.</p><p class="description">If you have any dietary restrictions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:miracolowedding@gmail.com">miracolowedding@gmail.com</a>.</p></div><div class="right-panel"><img src="images/about.jpg"></div></section><section id="transportation" class="panel-wrap"><div class="left-panel"><img src="images/transportation.jpg"></div><div class="right-panel"><h3 class="panel-headline">Transportation</h3><p class="description">To get to Lidö, you can either travel directly by boat from Stockholm, or drive and then take a short boat ride from the mainland. Alternatively, for those with their own boats, Lidö has a guest harbor a short walk from the inn.</p><p class="description">The boat departing from the Strömkajen pier in Stockholm City takes about four hours and is an incredible way to experience the archipelago. If the weather is beautiful, you can grab a seat outside and soak up some sun while gliding past the many islands scattered along the east coast of Sweden. The boat company does not take reservations, so we recommend arriving about 30 minutes early to the pier, just to make sure that you get a seat next to your friends and family. There is a café onboard, which serves both food and beverages, but feel free to bring your own as well. This travel option costs 130 SEK/15 USD, and you buy tickets onboard. As you are disembarking, you will just hand over your ticket to the crewmembers.</p><p class="description">Because we are in the off-season right now, boat schedules have not yet been published. We will post more information and links here as soon as they have been issued. In the meantime, please keep in mind that there will only be a few departures to choose from.</p><p class="description">PS. Hotel Lydmar and Radisson Blu Strand Hotel, both great accommodation alternatives in Stockholm, are located a stone’s throw away from the Strömkajen pier.</p><p class="description">If you would choose to drive, you would head either northeast from Stockholm City or east from Arlanda Airport, aiming for Räfsnäs Pier (in Swedish: Räfsnäs Brygga), which sits right on the coast. This drive takes approximately 1 hour 20 minutes, regardless of the starting point, and cars can be left at the pier for the weekend. From the pier, it’s a ten-minute boat ride to Lidö. This boat ride costs 45 SEK/5 USD, and tickets are purchased onboard. As far as schedules go, the same applies here – we are in the offseason now, so we will post more information and schedules as soon as they are published.</p><p class="description">Driving directions from Arlanda Airport: Get on road 273 and continue until you reach route 77. Follow route 77 to E18. Continue on E18 toward Norrtälje/Kapellskär, and keep right and continue on E18 toward Kapellskär before you reach the town of Norrtälje. Then, follow signs to the left to Gräddö/Räfsnäs. After 2km, turn right to Räfsnäs, park you car and walk 200 meters down to the pier.</p><p class="description">Driving directions from Stockholm: Follow E18 toward Norrtälje/Kapellskär, and keep right and continue on E18 toward Kapellskär before you reach the town of Norrtälje.

Lidö is located 59° 46’ N, 19° 4’ E, 1 nautical mile north of Räfsnäs and 3 nautical miles south of Björkö/Arholma. There is a guest harbor with enough space for some 50 boats, and there are onsite showers and bathrooms. The fee is 120 SEK/14 USD per night. As an alternative, there is a natural harbor on the opposite side of the island, where you can anchor as you please.</p><p class="description">To get to Stockholm from Arlanda:</p><p class="description">Arlanda Express: 20-minute speed train straight from the airport to the Stockholm Central Station. There are self-service ticket machines at the airport, and a one-way trip costs 280 SEK/33 USD. Children travel for free. <a href="http://www.arlandaexpress.com" target="_blank">www.arlandaexpress.com</a></p><p class="description">Flygbussarna (Airport Coaches): 40-minute bus ride straight from the airport to different locations in Stockholm City (the Central Station being the last stop). One-way tickets are 119 SEK/14 USD (99 SEK/12 USD if purchased online). Children travel for free. There are self-service ticket machines at the airport, but you can also pay onboard if you’re using a credit or debit card. <a href="http://www.flygbussarna.se" target="_blank">www.flygbussarna.se</a></p><p class="description">For information regarding travel in Stockholm, see section “Stockholm”.</p></div></section><section id="accommodation" class="panel-wrap"><div class="left-panel"><h3 class="panel-headline">Accommodation</h3><p class="description">Rooms have been reserved at the inn at a special rate for the weekend. Please fill out the enclosed RSVP card, indicating what nights you will be staying with us, and we will be taking care of the rest.</p><p class="description">The comfortable yet simple rooms at Lidö come in different shapes and sizes: there are double, triple and quad rooms (all with shared bathrooms and showers), located either right by the main building or a five-minute walk away. The theme for the weekend is the old Swedish saying “finns the hjärterum, så finns det stjärterum”, which loosely translates into “if there is enough room in our hearts, then there is enough room for our behinds”. In other words, you might have to share your space with some friends, but we will of course do our very best to place you in a room that suits all your needs. All the rooms will be equipped with bed linen and towels, so do not worry about bringing your own. Breakfast is included in the price, and the cost is 450 SEK/55 USD per night per person. Payment can be made upon departure on Sunday, and Lidö Värdshus accepts cash (SEK) and credit/debit cards.</p></div><div class="right-panel"><img src="images/accommodation.jpg"></div></section><section id="lido" class="panel-wrap"><div class="left-panel"><img src="images/lido.jpg"></div><div class="right-panel"><h3 class="panel-headline">Lidö</h3><p class="description">The archipelago of Stockholm consists of some thirty thousand islands. Only accessible by boat and undisturbed by car traffic, Lidö is one of them. Here, all you will find is pristine nature, a small organic farm, and the inn where we will be celebrating with you – Lidö Värdshus.</p><p class="description">The inn occupies an old mansion, with one main building and several smaller buildings spread out on the property, and consists of one restaurant and a variety of accommodation alternatives. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating, and has its own bar. Lidö Inn has become a very popular destination among the boat vacationing crowd thanks to its beautiful setting overlooking the water, its great food and its relaxed ambience.</p><p class="description">On the island, there's also a small café by the guest harbor - perfect for a lighter meal or a snack - and a (very) small grocery store, which sells items such as ice cream, freshly baked bread and other necessities.</p><p class="description"></p><p class="description"></p><p class="description"></p><p class="description"></p><p class="description"></p><p class="description"></p></div></section><section id="stockholm" class="panel-wrap"><div class="left-panel"><h3 class="panel-headline">Stockholm</h3><p class="description">If you have some time to spare, a visit to Stockholm (where Sophia spent the first 25 years of her life) is highly recommended. The city encompasses 14 islands and some 50 bridges, yet it still feels very compact and you can easily walk from one neighborhood to the next. Make sure to check out the medieval architecture and narrow cobblestone alleyways of Gamla Stan (Old Town), the lush greenery of Djurgården, the art galleries, cafés and unique shops of bohemian Södermalm and the parks, fashion districts and great restaurants of the Vasastan/Norrmalm/Östermalm area. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zhRbMlcfA3f4.kXOllGdk8gcA&usp=sharing">Click here</a>, and you will find a Sophia-made map with a list of recommended hotels, restaurants, cafés and activities for your time in the city. If you would like further tips and/or guidance, we would be more than happy to assist in any way possible. See “Contact” for details.</p><p class="description">Getting around Stockholm: The best way to explore the city is by foot. If, however, you would like to get from A to B a little faster, the subway as well as the inner city buses are easy to navigate and very reliable. You use the same ticket system for both services – the so-called “Access card”, which is an electronic smart card. The cards cost 20 SEK/2.50 USD to buy, and then you can either add credit to the card and pay per ride, or choose one of the travel cards (e.g. 24-hour). The Access card is also valid for traveling by boat, both in the city (a popular way of getting from Södermalm to Djurgården, for example) and to the rest of the archipelago. Fares differ between land and water journeys, but whatever credit you have on your card can be used toward purchasing tickets to Lidö.
